# @gleanwork/connect-mcp-server

Connect an MCP client to Glean's remote MCP servers for tools and agents.

This is a fork of the excellent [mcp-remote](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) that provides OAuth support with discovery fallback to `openid-configuration`.  For more details see [this issue](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/issues/616).

> **Note**
> Glean's remote MCP is currently in private beta and is not yet generally available to all customers.
